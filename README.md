# Summary

The goal of this project is to apply the modeling techniques to help classify emotion based on voice data. Furthermore, we have used multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze the CREMA-D, TESS, RAVDESS, SAVEE datasets to provide valuable insights into the performance of different approaches to emotion detection.
